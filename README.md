# Chronic Kidney_Disease Classification 
<P>This machine learning model employs various classification techniques, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict the likelihood of a patient having chronic kidney disease. By integrating multiple algorithms, the model enhances its predictive accuracy and robustness, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and intervention.</P>
